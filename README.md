# Material-characterization-using-Microstrip-patch-antenna
I done a summer project on material characterization using Microstrip patch antenna by classify their dielectric constant valuses.
This antenna operates at 2.4 GHz and I have used PEC for the patch.
I have done the fabrication in my college PCB lab under the guidance of the staffs.
